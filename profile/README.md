## Hi there 👋

🙋‍♀️🙋‍♂️ [**T**iny **W**eather **F**orecast **G**ermany](https://github.com/tinyweatherforecastgermanygroup/TinyWeatherForecastGermany) is a free open source app for **android** devices coded in Java and powered by open data provided by the **D**eutscher **W**etter**d**ienst (DWD) Germany's national weather agency (similar to [NOAA](https://www.noaa.gov) in 🇺🇸).

One of the key features of *Kleine Wettervorschau Deutschland* ([**T**iny**W**eather**F**orecast**G**ermany](https://tinyweatherforecastgermanygroup.frama.io/) in 🇩🇪) is the integration with **Gadgetbridge** as a weather data provider for smart gadgets.

The app is available on the [**F-Droid**](https://f-droid.org/packages/de.kaffeemitkoffein.tinyweatherforecastgermany/) app store.

TinyWeatherForecastGermany is not affiliated or officially supported or approved with/by the DWD, the WMO, related organizations or individuals.
